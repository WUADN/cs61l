                            <b>CS 106L</b> is designed to be a relaxed course that's mainly for your learning! 
                            We've packed our lectures with content, and provide short assignments that expose you to a myriad of technologies
                            and allow you to test your own understanding of standard C++.
                            Please reach out to us if you have any questions about these policies. 
                            You can reach us at the course staff email (see the main page) or through a private EdStem post.

                            Attending lecture is part of your attendance grade. We will give out quick attendance forms at the beginning of each lecture in which you will enter the secret word of the day.
                            It is against the Stanford Honor Code to share the attendance code with students who missed a lecture. We don't take attendance in week 1 to accomodate late adds and the shopping period. 
                            You are allowed to miss 2 of the 13 required lectures without penalty. If you are not able to attend lecture for some reason
                            (e.g. illness, religious holiday, academic or University conflict, family emergency etc), email us to let us know.

                            There are seven assignments, assigned weekly starting week 2. 
                            To pass the class, you must successfully complete <b>six out of seven assignments</b>.
                            Criteria for "successfully completing" each assignment will be included in the assignment specs. Above all, you'll get out 
                            of these assignments what you put in!
